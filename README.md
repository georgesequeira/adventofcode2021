# Advent of Code 2021
This respository is an attempt to finish the challenges for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) event in winter 2021.

This is going to be written in [clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org/). The tools that we are going to use for simplicity:

* [clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
* [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs)
* [clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org)

We also installed [calva](https://calva.io/) as a extension of VSCode to allow for an interactie repl.
# Installing Clojure

```
brew install clojure/tools/clojure
```

```
had to update my system to have the new dev tools.
```

# Using Clojure on it's own.
